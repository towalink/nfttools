# NftTools

Help interacting with nftables

NftTools provides helpers to work with nftables from Python. It builds on python-nftables which itself uses libnftables. Note that the API is not yet stable and can change from one version to the next.

---

## Features

- Convert an nftables rule into its JSON representation.
- Validate an nftables rule by temporary applying it in a helper chain.
- Convert simple rules into a dictionary representation.
- Convert that dictionary representation into an nftables rule.
- Supports IPv4 and IPv6.
- Provides limited support for sets.

## Installation

Install using PyPi:

```shell
pip3 install nfttools
```

Note: The tool uses `python3-nftables` as dependency. If you don't use Debian's operating system package (or Alpine's `py3-nftables`) but attempt to install `pip-nftables` instead, the latter might complain on missing "schema.json". Workaround: Use the operating system package or copy it's "schema.json" to the place `pip-nftables` is looking for that file.
